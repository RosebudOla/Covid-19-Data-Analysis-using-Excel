# Project Name: Covid 19 Data Analysis Using Excel

----
# Problem statement: Objective
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions worldwide, leading to significant health and economic challenges. This analysis examines the global spread of the virus by evaluating confirmed cases, death rates, and key trends across various countries. The study aims to highlight the most and least affected countries and provide insights into the overall impact of the pandemic. create a dashboard using Excel to help support public health decisions and responses.
----
# Data Sourcing
The data set was sourced from COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University and scraped from Github
----
# Data Cleaning and Transformation
The dataset was opened in Excel for exploration, cleaning and analysis using pivot tables. The dataset was further checked for duplicates and null values.Data types were crosschecked and adjusted.
----
# Data Visualization
Excel and Excel Pivot Charts was used to visualize findings for better analysis and understanding.

# Findings and Insights
The United States recorded the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, significantly outpacing other nations.
India, Brazil, and France also had substantial case counts, reflecting the widespread transmission in these populous countries.
The least affected regions included isolated areas such as Antarctica and controlled environments like the Holy See and the MS Zaandam cruise ship.
The global mortality rate of 1.39% indicates that while many people contracted the virus, a large proportion recovered.
The cumulative case data shows the increasing trend over the years, with 2022 having the highest recorded cases, reflecting the peak of the pandemic

# Recommendation
The analysis highlights the vast differences in case distribution, influenced by factors such as population density, public health policies, and testing capacity. Moving forward, continued investment in healthcare infrastructure, vaccination programs, and pandemic preparedness is crucial to mitigating future outbreaks. Nations with high case counts should focus on strengthening their healthcare systems, while countries with low cases must maintain strict preventive measures.
